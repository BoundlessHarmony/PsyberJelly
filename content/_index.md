# ðŸª¼ Welcome to the Cove ðŸª¼

Here you may find some interesting projects I've developed in the realm of detection engineering and machine learning for cyber security. You might be wondering what the deal is with the Jellyfish theming. Or not, either way you are still reading this, and in for a penny, in for a pound right? 

Throughout life and career, I've often felt like the humble jellyfish. Consider the life of such a one, if you would. They live and die by currents beyond their power to influence, let alone comprehend. Taken by a swift rush of water, they have but a small influence in the general course of their trajectories relative to the forces imposed upon them. Whilst not powerless to navigate for food or preferred habitat, the magnitude of relative strength's are clear. 

The ocean is vast and unforgiving, yet the noble jellyfish persists amongst the horrors of the oceanic world, making the most of what it comes across in it's (largely) compelled travels. It makes it's small course corrections, aims for the best, and accepts all that comes nevertheless. The Cove is a little nook, a safe haven from the unforgiving waters.
